# Movies To Make
This project gives data on successful films on IMDB. It will also identify what movie Microsoft should start producing. 
The data that was obtained has been cleaned for the purpose of organization and easier readability.  



## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to identify which genre makes the highest max gross. This will help identify the biggest profit based on genre types. Not only will the data provide profit, but also provide the IMDB scores for each genres.

### Data
As I webscrapped the IMDB and BoxOfficMojo, there was complications on obtaining the data that I needed. 
I decided to used an csv from github that was available for the public.

* Pandas, jupyter
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib


## Project Description
Some questions we asked along the way was what genre can give us the most profit in total. The profits will also allow us to differenciate between weaker genres that will not give us the high income margins. As we find the weakers genres out of the bunch, we can also keep note of which to not produce. Another question was which genre had the most ratings and which has the highest reviews. 

## Needs of this project

- data scrapping
- data exploration
- data processing and cleaning
